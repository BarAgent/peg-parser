This is a faithful but na√Øve translation of the Dylan grammar from the DRM. It
does not provide error correction and could be better optimized.

Most importantly, it does not refer to a name database to distinguish whether a
given name is a macro or a binding and does not expand macros and re-parse
their expansion. Both are essential functions of any real Dylan parser.
